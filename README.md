yep. The whole video.

## why is there no audio?
there was supposed to be audio, tho because of copyright i decided to remove it on the github repo.

## how do i add audio?
- download the in the end music file as an mp3
- put it in the root folder of the repo and name it as "audio.mp3"
- play it (also make sure your default media player is windows media player otherwise your media player won't close)

## the video isn't synced!
open play.bat in a text editor and you'll see why.
