## how to view in the virtual end through your dos machine
- download and extract this github repository
- look for the "program" folder and open it
- look for "load.bat" and execute it
- look for "play.bat" and execute it

## idk if this is a faq section

### why is there no audio?
there was supposed to be audio, tho because of copyright i decided to remove it on the github repo.

### how do i add audio?
- download the in the end music file as an mp3
- put it in the root folder of the repo and name it as "audio.mp3"
- play it (also make sure your default media player is windows media player otherwise your media player won't close)

### the video isn't synced!
open play.bat in a text editor and you'll see why.

### dude, why are there over 200 images in the program's folder?
those are the images. yes, i am THAT humble.




also PLEASE FORK MY REPO I NEED SOMEONE TO FIX MY GOD-AWFUL CODE.
